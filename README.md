# system-monitor

This is a script that I made for a class project. This script is to view system information, and network information, including CPU, memory, disk and network, along with checking internet connectivity. I do it useful because it analyzes the system, without the need to write so many commands.

<h2>Installation & Usage</h2>
<hr></hr>
git clone https://github.com/TheHellishPandaa/system-monitor.git
<hr></hr>
Then, 
<hr></hr>
cd system-monitor
<hr></hr>
Then, make the script executable.
<hr></hr>
chmod +x system-monitor.sh
<hr></hr>
Run the Script
<hr></hr>
./system-monitor.sh
<hr></hr>
Then, to automate this script you can edit the .bashrc file, and in the last line you put the path to the script. for example
<hr></hr>
nano .bashrc
<hr></hr>
Then, in the last line you put the path to the script.
<hr></hr>
/route/to/script.sh
<hr></hr>

You can Modify, Download or Use this script ;)
